Simple trickle testing tool for learning Golang

This is very prototypie at this point - wrote this a while ago to learn the basics of Go, and thought a trickle/connection load testing tool would be a good use scenario for Golang.

Still needs a lot of improvements and updates (and learning features and how to do things in Golang), but it's a good start I think.
